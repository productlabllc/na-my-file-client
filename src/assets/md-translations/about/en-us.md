## About My File

My File allows families to upload and share documents with the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) during their applications for shelter. It is also a safe and secure place for families to store their private documents for safekeeping to download and use for other things.

My File can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices.

My File is currently in pilot.
